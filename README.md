Book Management System API

This is a Ruby on Rails API for managing a library system where users can borrow and return books. The system tracks user balances, book availability, and generates reports.

Features

User Management:

Each user has an initial account number and balance.
Users can borrow and return books (deducting or adding fees to their balance).
Users cannot borrow books if their balance is insufficient.

Book Management:

Tracks the total and available copies of each book.
Calculates income generated by a book within a specified time range.

Reporting:

Query a userâ€™s account status (balance and borrowed books).
Generate monthly and annual reports for a user (number of books borrowed and total spending).
